Today's lesson we are going to set up `Non-commertial open source` version.


# Installation Guideline

first, clone that source repository:

- https://github.com/mesadhan/processmaker-docker

then, navigate to that directory using `cd processmaker-docker` command.

Generally Running process with docker composer up in demon or background

`Note` Database not connected properly, cause `Host Name` not found. So now, inspect into specific mysql container id or name like below and get `"IPAddress": "172.16.150.2"` from `Network Section`. 

    docker ps
    docker inspect [396319b4c448]

    Or,
